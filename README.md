# TH-JGJ-Project-1
Project 1 for Treehouse course.

Website with three pages: index,about and photos.

Have tried it on Chrome, Edge and Safari works fine.

Could not get one line passed CSS validator need to dig in to it more 
     /* display: -ms-flexbox;      TWEENER - IE 10 */ Line 174 of Style.css 
     kept throwing up errors. so commeted it out for now.

Going to ask the group to look at it now - scary!
